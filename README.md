# Profiler

This project is a simple web-based profile form application that allows users to view and update their profile details. It features form validation, data persistence, and user feedback through alert messages.

## Features

- Responsive and modern form UI styled with CSS using the Poppins font.
- Form fields for first name, last name, email, and bio.
- Client-side form validation to ensure data correctness.
- Data persistence using JavaScript modules to save and retrieve profile details.
- User feedback with success and error alert messages.
- Smooth UI interactions including focus states and button hover effects.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the form markup.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for the form and page layout.
- `index.js`: Main JavaScript file that handles form interactions, validation, and data persistence.
- `modules/`
  - `formValidator.js`: Module responsible for validating form input data.
  - `profileManager.js`: Module responsible for saving and retrieving profile data.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The form will be pre-filled with saved profile details if available.
3. Update the form fields as needed.
4. Submit the form to validate and save the data.
5. Success or error messages will be displayed below the form.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (ES6 modules)

## Notes

- The form uses client-side validation only.
- Data persistence is handled locally (e.g., using `localStorage`).
- The alert messages are dynamically shown/hidden based on form submission results.
